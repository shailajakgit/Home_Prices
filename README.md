# Home_Prices

This project describes my approach to predicting home prices from home features. This house prices dataset is from [this] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) Kaggle competition. 

This dataset contains 1460 rows, with values in 1/3 of rows missing. 

The analysis contains the following steps:
1. Determine the distribution of the dependent variable with and without transformations.
2. Cleaning the missing data as appropriate.
3. Trying out multiple predictive models, comparing them and choosing the final model.
