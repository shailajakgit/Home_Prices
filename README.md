# Home_Prices

This project describes my approach to predicting home prices from home features. The house prices dataset I used is from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) Kaggle competition. 

This dataset contains 1460 rows, with values in 1/3 of rows missing. 

The analysis contains the following steps:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Determining the distribution of the dependent variable with and without transformations.
2. Data Cleaning: Cleaning the data as appropriate.
3. Model Building: Trying out multiple predictive models, comparing them and choosing the final model.
4. Insights: Assessing how various variables used in the model impact home prices.
